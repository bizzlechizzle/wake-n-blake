# gitup v0.1.0

Quick commit and push with AI-generated conventional commit message.

## Workflow

1. Run `git add -A` to stage all changes
2. Run `git diff --cached --stat` to see what changed
3. Run `git diff --cached` to get the full diff
4. Generate commit message using the rules below
5. Run `git commit -m "<message>"`
6. Run `git push`

## Commit Message Rules

**FORMAT**: `<type>(<optional-scope>): <description>`

**TYPES**:
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation
- `refactor` - Code restructure, no behavior change
- `test` - Tests
- `chore` - Maintenance
- `perf` - Performance
- `style` - Formatting
- `build` - Build/CI changes

**STYLE**:
- Imperative mood: "add" not "added"
- Under 50 characters
- Lowercase, no ending period
- Focus on WHAT and WHY

**FORBIDDEN**:
- No emojis
- No "Generated by AI" or similar footer
- No "Co-Authored-By" attribution

## Edge Cases

### No Changes
If there are no staged changes and no untracked files, report "Nothing to commit" and stop.

### Push Fails
If push fails (no upstream, rejected, etc.), report the error and suggest the fix command (e.g., `git push -u origin <branch>`).

### Large Diff
If the diff is very large (many files/changes), summarize the main categories of changes rather than listing every file.
